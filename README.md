s2h_cake_
========
I don't want to keep this.
The CakePHP version of S2H

After cloning don't forget to create the 'tmp' directory in the base directory and make it 777.  Also copy webroot/index.php.default to webroot/index.php and update it to point to your local instance of cake.  Copy Config/database.php.default to Config/database.php and update with your db connections.  Copy Config/core.php.default to Config/core.php. The database schema is in the sql folder.
